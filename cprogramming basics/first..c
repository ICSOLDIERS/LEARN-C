// Variables:--- a variables is a container which stores a value. In kitchen we have containers stroring rice ,dal ,sugar etc.
// similar to that variables in c stores values of a constant 

// a = 3 ;   a is assinged 3     "semicolon is instruction terminator"
// b = 4.7;  b is assigned 4.7
// c = "A";  c is storing "A"

// RULES FOR NAMING IN VARIABLES:
// 1.FIRST CHARECTER MUST ME ALPHABET OR UNDERSCORE
// 2.NO COMMAS ,BLANKS ALLOWED
// 3.NO SPECIAL SYMBOL OTHER THAN UNDERSCORE
// 4.VARIABLE NAME IS CASE-SENSITIVE
// WE MUST CREATE MEANINGFULL VARIABLES.THIS ENHANCE READABILITYOF OUR PROGRAM
// #############################################################################################################################################

// CONSTANTS:--An entity whose doesnot cahnge is called constants.a variable is an entity which value can be changed.

// type of constants:
// 1.integer constants: -1,6,4,7,9
// 2.real constants :- -327.1,2.5.7.0
// 3.charecter constants: 'a','#','@'  must be written in single inverted comma

// ##############################################################################################################################################

// KEYWORDS: these are reserved words whose meaning already known to compiler .there are 32 keywords availabe in c.
// auto break case char const continue default do double long return register short signed sizeof static int else enum extern float for goto if 
// struct typedef union unsigned void volatile while

// our first c program :

// lok at above

// BASIC STRUCTURE OF A C PROGRAM :all c program have to fllow a basic structure . a c program starts with a main function and execute 
// instructions present inside it .
// each instruction is terminated with a semicolon(;)
// there are some rules which are applicable to all cprogram:
// 1.very program excution must start with main function.
// 2.all the statements are terminated by semicolon.
// 3.instructions are case-sensitive.
// 4.instructions are execute in the same order in which they are written.

// COMMENTS IN C:
// 1:SINGLE LINE COMMENT :   // 
// 2.MULTILINE COMMENT:  /*    DKSFN  */

// #############################################################################################################################################


/* THIS IS OUR FIRST C PROGRAM THATS IT!*/
// COMMENTS ARE JUST PRASED NOT EXECUTED.

// COMPILATION AND EXECUTION:a compiler is a computer program which converts a c program into a machine lang so it can be easily understand by the computer.
// file.c---->c compiler ------> file.exe this is the process .


/* a c program is written in plain texts .this plain text is combination of instructions in a particular sequence .the compiler performs some basic 
checks and finallly converts the program into an executable*/

// LIBRARY FUNCTIONS IN C: 
/* c language has a lot of valuab;le library functions which is used to carry out certain tasks .for instance printf function is used to
print the value on the screen.

*/
/* 
printf("this is %d",i)
%d for integers
%f for reals
%c for charecters
